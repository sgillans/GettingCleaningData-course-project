In this repository you will find code to process the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" that was originally published as:
[1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

The script "run_analysis.R" consolidate the "test" and "train" data into a single dataset containing just the mean and standard deviation features. The script also prepares a table containing the averages of all mean and standard deviation features by activity and subject.

For a full description of the dataset please see the README.txt file contained in archive located:
